# Example sentinel.conf

# port <sentinel-port>
# The port that this sentinel instance will run on
port 26379
# 指定sentinel的端口，默认是26379

# sentinel announce-ip <ip>
# sentinel announce-port <port>
#
# The above two configuration directives are useful in environments where,
# because of NAT, Sentinel is reachable from outside via a non-local address.
# 在NAT（Network Address Translation，网络地址转换）环境，使用上面两个参数可用非本地ip使sentinel被外部连接。
#
# When announce-ip is provided, the Sentinel will claim the specified IP address
# in HELLO messages used to gossip its presence, instead of auto-detecting the
# local address as it usually does.
# 当announce-ip设置时，Sentinel将会在HELLO消息中声明这个ip，而不是像通常那样自动探测本机地址。
#
# Similarly when announce-port is provided and is valid and non-zero, Sentinel
# will announce the specified TCP port.
# announce-port同上（合法非0的端口）。
#
# The two options don't need to be used together, if only announce-ip is
# provided, the Sentinel will announce the specified IP and the server port
# as specified by the "port" option. If only announce-port is provided, the
# Sentinel will announce the auto-detected local IP and the specified port.
# 两个参数不需要同时设定，如果只设置了announce-ip，port配置起作用。如果只设置了announce-port，则会自动探测本地ip。
#
# Example:
#
# sentinel announce-ip 1.2.3.4

# dir <working-directory>
# Every long running process should have a well-defined working directory.
# For Redis Sentinel to chdir to /tmp at startup is the simplest thing
# for the process to don't interfere with administrative tasks such as
# unmounting filesystems.
# ？？不知道干嘛的
dir /tmp

# sentinel monitor <master-name> <ip> <redis-port> <quorum>
#
# Tells Sentinel to monitor this master, and to consider it in O_DOWN
# (Objectively Down) state only if at least <quorum> sentinels agree.
# 告诉Sentinel来监听哪个主机（主机名称），主机IP，主机端口，客观失效需要Sentinel同意的数量。
#
# Note that whatever is the ODOWN quorum, a Sentinel will require to
# be elected by the majority of the known Sentinels in order to
# start a failover, so no failover can be performed in minority.
# 注意：无论你设置要多少个 Sentinel 同意才能判断一个服务器失效， 一个 Sentinel 都需要获得系统中多数（majority） Sentinel 的支持， 才能发起一次自动故障迁移。
# 换句话说， 在只有少数（minority）Sentinel 进程正常运作的情况下， Sentinel 是不能执行自动故障迁移的。
#
# Slaves are auto-discovered, so you don't need to specify slaves in
# any way. Sentinel itself will rewrite this configuration file adding
# the slaves using additional configuration options.
# Also note that the configuration file is rewritten when a
# slave is promoted to master.
# 从机是自动发现的，所以你不需要指明从机。Sentinel会重写这个配置文件来添加从机的配置。同时当从机被推举为主机时，该配置文件也会重写。
#
# Note: master name should not include special characters or spaces.
# The valid charset is A-z 0-9 and the three characters ".-_".
# 注意：主机名称不能包含特殊字符或者空格。有效的字符是A-z 0-9 和 .-_。
sentinel monitor mymaster 127.0.0.1 6379 2

# sentinel auth-pass <master-name> <password>
#
# Set the password to use to authenticate with the master and slaves.
# Useful if there is a password set in the Redis instances to monitor.
# 在redis实例设置了密码时，使用这个参数进行验证。
#
# Note that the master password is also used for slaves, so it is not
# possible to set a different password in masters and slaves instances
# if you want to be able to monitor these instances with Sentinel.
# 注意：被Sentinel监控的主从机的密码都需要一致。
#
# However you can have Redis instances without the authentication enabled
# mixed with Redis instances requiring the authentication (as long as the
# password set is the same for all the instances requiring the password) as
# the AUTH command will have no effect in Redis instances with authentication
# switched off.
# 然而，也可以某些实例设置密码，某些不设置（设置了密码的，密码得一样）。
# Example:
#
# sentinel auth-pass mymaster MySUPER--secret-0123passw0rd

# sentinel down-after-milliseconds <master-name> <milliseconds>
#
# Number of milliseconds the master (or any attached slave or sentinel) should
# be unreachable (as in, not acceptable reply to PING, continuously, for the
# specified period) in order to consider it in S_DOWN state (Subjectively
# Down).
# 如果一个服务器没有在 master-down-after-milliseconds 选项所指定的时间内， 对向它发送 PING 命令的 Sentinel 返回一个有效回复（valid reply）， 那么 Sentinel 就会将这个服务器标记为主观下线。
#
# Default is 30 seconds.
# 默认30s。
sentinel down-after-milliseconds mymaster 30000

# sentinel parallel-syncs <master-name> <numslaves>
#
# How many slaves we can reconfigure to point to the new slave simultaneously
# during the failover. Use a low number if you use the slaves to serve query
# to avoid that all the slaves will be unreachable at about the same
# time while performing the synchronization with the master.
# 指定了在执行故障转移时， 最多可以有多少个从服务器同时对新的主服务器进行同步， 这个数字越小， 完成故障转移所需的时间就越长。如果从机用于读操作，可以把这个值设置小一些，防止所有的从机同时同步而不可读。
sentinel parallel-syncs mymaster 1

# sentinel failover-timeout <master-name> <milliseconds>
#
# Specifies the failover timeout in milliseconds. It is used in many ways:
# 设置故障迁移超时时间（毫秒），若sentinel在该配置值内未能完成failover操作，则认为本次故障迁移失败。
#
# - The time needed to re-start a failover after a previous failover was
#   already tried against the same master by a given Sentinel, is two
#   times the failover timeout.
#
# - The time needed for a slave replicating to a wrong master according
#   to a Sentinel current configuration, to be forced to replicate
#   with the right master, is exactly the failover timeout (counting since
#   the moment a Sentinel detected the misconfiguration).
#
# - The time needed to cancel a failover that is already in progress but
#   did not produced any configuration change (SLAVEOF NO ONE yet not
#   acknowledged by the promoted slave).
#
# - The maximum time a failover in progress waits for all the slaves to be
#   reconfigured as slaves of the new master. However even after this time
#   the slaves will be reconfigured by the Sentinels anyway, but not with
#   the exact parallel-syncs progression as specified.
#
# Default is 3 minutes.
sentinel failover-timeout mymaster 180000

# SCRIPTS EXECUTION
#
# sentinel notification-script and sentinel reconfig-script are used in order
# to configure scripts that are called to notify the system administrator
# or to reconfigure clients after a failover. The scripts are executed
# with the following rules for error handling:
#
# If script exits with "1" the execution is retried later (up to a maximum
# number of times currently set to 10).
# 脚本的执行结果若为1，即稍后重试（最大重试次数为10）。
#
# If script exits with "2" (or an higher value) the script execution is
# not retried.
# 若为2，则执行结束。
#
# If script terminates because it receives a signal the behavior is the same
# as exit code 1.
#
# A script has a maximum running time of 60 seconds. After this limit is
# reached the script is terminated with a SIGKILL and the execution retried.
# 脚本最大执行时间为60秒，超时会被终止执行。

# NOTIFICATION SCRIPT
# 通知脚本 不翻译了。。。。
#
# sentinel notification-script <master-name> <script-path>
# 
# Call the specified notification script for any sentinel event that is
# generated in the WARNING level (for instance -sdown, -odown, and so forth).
# This script should notify the system administrator via email, SMS, or any
# other messaging system, that there is something wrong with the monitored
# Redis systems.
#
# The script is called with just two arguments: the first is the event type
# and the second the event description.
#
# The script must exist and be executable in order for sentinel to start if
# this option is provided.
#
# Example:
#
# sentinel notification-script mymaster /var/redis/notify.sh

# CLIENTS RECONFIGURATION SCRIPT
#
# sentinel client-reconfig-script <master-name> <script-path>
#
# When the master changed because of a failover a script can be called in
# order to perform application-specific tasks to notify the clients that the
# configuration has changed and the master is at a different address.
# 
# The following arguments are passed to the script:
#
# <master-name> <role> <state> <from-ip> <from-port> <to-ip> <to-port>
#
# <state> is currently always "failover"
# <role> is either "leader" or "observer"
# 
# The arguments from-ip, from-port, to-ip, to-port are used to communicate
# the old address of the master and the new address of the elected slave
# (now a master).
#
# This script should be resistant to multiple invocations.
#
# Example:
#
# sentinel client-reconfig-script mymaster /var/redis/reconfig.sh
